<h1>Tuesday, August 23rd</h1>
<p>I've kind of got things figured out. I've gotten help from Drew and the teachers and can now edit my website from vscode.</p>
<p>As a reminder for later, I'll put some html things here (replace ^ with left and right arrows); ^a href="(insert link here)"^ is for links, </p>
<p>This html knowledge will not help me, I was supposed to be making .ipynb files instead of .md files. Now I know, and will continue using jupyter notebooks instead. The jupyter notebooks use python, however, and it's a lot more complicated than html's ^p^ and ^/p^</p>
