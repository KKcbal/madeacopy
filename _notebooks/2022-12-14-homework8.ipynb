    "oh my god i just looked at the requirements and there's no way im doing that right now. right now being 7:42 pm on thursday. I think I could definitely do that but I spent so much time doing this that I don't want to. there wasn't really anything too hard about this. the only thing slowing me was my self. I kept getting off track and couldn't think several times while trying to figure out what i was doing. I could have done this pretty quickly if I was normal and had an attention span longer than a goldfish. The code isnt too hard to understand. there's two lists and two variables. one pair is temporary and the other pair is the final pair. the temporary pair resets after each loop. if the temporary variable (the distance) is less than the final variable, then the final list and variable change to the temporary variable and list's values. The order of schools is randomized. It doesn't check for duplicates and doesn't end on del norte. it does, however, start on del norte. "
