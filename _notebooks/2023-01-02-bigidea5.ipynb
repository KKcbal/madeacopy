    "I think these are very extreme cases of gamers getting into games. While there's a fair amount of people in the gaming community like this, it's definitely not all. These are the most extreme cases of gaming, where you go as far as possible into it as you can. People who get into gaming don't tend to spend 18 hours a day on it, a large majority of gamers sprinkle it in their days, like you would a hobby. You could easily pull out the most extreme cases of any hobby and apply this thinking to that hobby, but it would be wrong, There's a lot more to gaming than this. Maybe something like gaming is easier to get dopamine out of, and it causes more people to be attracted to it and center their life around it, but I think it's no different from other hobbies. I, personally, am an avid gamer. I do my fair share of gaming. Gaming has not impacted my grades, not any more than the other pass times I enjoy. When it comes down to it, gaming is not the problem, the person is. You need to have the restraint and responsibility to know when you've gone too far. Discipline like this should either be taught at a young age by parents or practiced in your own time. Overall, I don't think gaming is a hindrance to personal studies and high school in general."

With the first assistant having a female voice, the rest probably just followed suit. I don't think there was any ill intentions, and I don't think anything needs to be done about it. There's nothing harmful about it. Although females serving males was common preactice for a long time, that's no longer the case, and doesn't connect to virtual assistants. A female voice was probably more appealing because it can have a soothing, mother-like quality to it. \n",

I don't really think this is harmful. While it is extremely weird, a function like this on a laptop camera is pretty negligible, especially since it doesn't hinder the functionality of the camera. Something like this is more like a silly little addition that doesn't add too much to the camera. I think it definitely should be corrected. This setting they've created does not function as intended. It does not work for everyone and therefore should be fixed. A good way to prevent this would be to hand it to many employees for them to use. This puts it in public testing and allows for feedback to be easily deliviered since they work in the same company. Greater training too. Giving more data to the camera, different people, different lightings, different backgrounds, would ensure that no matter what, the camera could detect anyone. "
