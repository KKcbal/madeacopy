    "There are definitely ways for me to improve my CPT project. I could make the UI more readable. I could scale the difficulty more, I feel like it's too easy right now. I could add more gimmicks, give more to do in the game. I should add update and delete. I think my priority is to add update. I don't think delete is too important. After that I'll make game adjustments. I'll scale the difficulty and finish coding a different attack for the player to use. One problem is that I can see the new attack becoming obsolete very quickly, as I currently have it's damage as a constant. I'm thinking of making it a multiple of the attack stat. \n",
