    "Bro, I'm still trying to work out how github works. I think I'm super far behind. I just figured out on Thursday how to make a notebook but I can't do much of anything else. That's no bueno. I changed the name of my repository but now I'm having some errors with things. I changed two things in the _config.yml file on github, I changed the name of the repository in that file to the new one. I think that might have messed some things up though, I'm not sure why. I'm gonna save and commit this change (the whole file) so I can test if it still has errors."
