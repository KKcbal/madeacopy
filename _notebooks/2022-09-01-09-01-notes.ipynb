This was a very fun thing to work on, it wasn't an assignment for class, it was just something I started out of curiosity of \"can I do it\" and finished because I had fun trying to figure out how to do it. Technically it's not complete, the last bit of the code I want is to clear the output so only the print(oddbool) bit is printed but I haven't figured out how to do that yet. For now, it's finished but not polished."

    " ranumlist is the list that contains the randomly generated numbers, they're appended later on so they're always different. list4 was for the for_loop. I think it originally contained only four numbers so the for_loop would loop 4 times but I'm not sure. n4 is a variable for 4, it was also for the for_loop with the same reason as list4. Honestly, I never really figured out how the loops worked. I don't know how the variables and lists affect the for loop when defining it. n10 is for the num_loop, it was created to loop num_loop 10 times for each of the odd numbers, I'll get into that later. oddNum is a list of all the odd numbers that can be generated, this is so I can compare each number to the number generated. n0 is a very important piece of the code. n0 is used to choose a list item from oddNum. Later I will explain how it plays into the code. n1 is an empty variable. It actually equals 1 but it's only used to fill space in an if else statement. Last is oddbool, it's used to tell another chunk of code if the number is odd."
