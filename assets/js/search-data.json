What is the minimum number of bits required for each binary sequence if the store has between 75 and 100 items in its inventory? Answer: 7 My answer: 6 I misunderstood binary . In which of the following situations would it be most appropriate to choose lossy compression over lossless compression? Answer: Storing music files on a smartphone in order to maximize the number of songs that can be stored My answer: Storing a formatted text document to be restored to its original version for a print publication I figured that a text document would suffer the least from lossy, so it&#39;s best to choose . The teacher wants to determine whether students who play a sport are more or less likely to have higher grade point averages than students who do not play any sports. Which of the following pairs of spreadsheets can be combined and analyzed to determine the desired information? Answer: Spreadsheets I and II My answer: Spreadsheets II and III I thought it would be better to sort through students in sports and students above 3.5 gpa rather than sort through students in sports and all students . Using only the data collected during the 7-day period, which of the following statements is true? Answer: The total number of items purchased on a given date can be determined by searching the data for all transactions that occurred on the given date and then adding the number of items purchased for each matching transaction. My answer: The method of payment that was used in the greatest number of transactions during the 7-day period can be determined by sorting the data by the method of payment, then adding the number of items purchased for each type of payment method, and then finding the maximum sum. I missread the answer. I now see that it was wrong, I just got mixed up from all the words . Which of the following expressions will evaluate to true if the restaurant should be counted and evaluates to false otherwise? Answer: (avgRating ≥ 4.0) AND ((prcRange = &quot;lo&quot;) OR (prcRange = &quot;med&quot;)) My answer: (avgRating ≥ 4.0) AND ((prcRange = &quot;lo&quot;) AND (prcRange = &quot;med&quot;)) I was just stupid with this one. I should have known it was or instead of and . There are definitely ways for me to improve my CPT project. I could make the UI more readable. I could scale the difficulty more, I feel like it&#39;s too easy right now. I could add more gimmicks, give more to do in the game. I should add update and delete. I think my priority is to add update. I don&#39;t think delete is too important. After that I&#39;ll make game adjustments. I&#39;ll scale the difficulty and finish coding a different attack for the player to use. One problem is that I can see the new attack becoming obsolete very quickly, as I currently have it&#39;s damage as a constant. I&#39;m thinking of making it a multiple of the attack stat. . Add update | increase opponent health or increase their damage | finish coding new attack | .",

Why is time and space complexity important when choosing an algorithm? . It will affect how fast the code will run. Should you always use a constant time algorithm / Should you never use an exponential time algorithm? Explain? | While constant time algorithms are very fast and exponential time algorithms aren&#39;t, it might be neccessary to use both. There may be cases where you can&#39;t use constant time algorithms, and it may be better to use a different one. What are some general patterns that you noticed to determine each algorithm&#39;s time and space complexity? | constant tends to be 1 or a few lines. Linear depends on a list, so they&#39;ll likely be a single for loop on a list. Quadratic will be a for loop inside a for loop. Logarithmic is something like binary search, and will grow logarithmically. | .",

Connects to a data source it executes sql code They both have a lot of built in functions that you can execute with them. No, results is defined as a list in the debugger. . import sqlite3 def create(): name = input(&quot;Enter your name:&quot;) uid = input(&quot;Enter your user id:&quot;) password = input(&quot;Enter your password&quot;) dob = input(&quot;Enter your date of birth &#39;YYYY-MM-DD&#39;&quot;) # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: # Execute an SQL command to insert data into a table cursor.execute(&quot;INSERT INTO users (_name, _uid, _password, _dob) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)&quot;, (name, uid, password, dob)) # Commit the changes to the database conn.commit() print(f&quot;A new user record {uid} has been created&quot;) except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while executing the INSERT:&quot;, error) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() #create() . Both create functions seem the same to me. This function does not encrypt the password though. They&#39;re not the same, but very similar. user init included the create function while insert is the create function. . import sqlite3 def update(): uid = input(&quot;Enter user id to update&quot;) password = input(&quot;Enter updated password&quot;) if len(password) &lt; 2: message = &quot;hacked&quot; password = &#39;gothackednewpassword123&#39; else: message = &quot;successfully updated&quot; # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: # Execute an SQL command to update data in a table cursor.execute(&quot;UPDATE users SET _password = ?

The hacked part will change your password to hacked the new password you inputted is less than two characters. I think except would occur when try fails. If there&#39;s an error while trying, then except will occur The definition and use of conn and cursor. They are necessary to interact with the sql database. . import sqlite3 def delete(): uid = input(&quot;Enter user id to delete&quot;) # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: cursor.execute(&quot;DELETE FROM users WHERE _uid = ?&quot;, (uid,)) if cursor.rowcount == 0: # The uid was not found in the table print(f&quot;No uid {uid} was not found in the table&quot;) else: # The uid was found in the table and the row was deleted print(f&quot;The row with uid {uid} was successfully deleted&quot;) conn.commit() except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while executing the DELETE:&quot;, error) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() #delete() . This delete function seems dangerous. It allows you to delete anyone without verifying if it&#39;s your account. . def menu(): operation = input(&quot;Enter: (C)reate (R)ead (U)pdate or (D)elete or (S)chema&quot;) if operation.lower() == &#39;c&#39;: create() elif operation.lower() == &#39;r&#39;: read() elif operation.lower() == &#39;u&#39;: update() elif operation.lower() == &#39;d&#39;: delete() elif operation.lower() == &#39;s&#39;: schema() elif len(operation)==0: # Escape Key return else: print(&quot;Please enter c, r, u, or d&quot;) menu() # recursion, repeat menu try: menu() # start menu except: print(&quot;Perform Jupyter &#39;Run All&#39; prior to starting menu&quot;) . So you can easily execute multiple actions without pressing the run button. Maybe you could put every function in a list, and execute functions by putting the user input in the list index .",

It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistence interface in Python. . Description from ChatGPT. The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for data analysis and machine learning. In the context of machine learning, accuracy refers to the percentage of correctly classified instances in a set of predictions. In this case, the testing data is a subset of the original Titanic dataset that the decision tree model has not seen during training......After training the decision tree model on the training data, we can evaluate its performance on the testing data by making predictions on the testing data and comparing them to the actual outcomes. The accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data tells us how well the model generalizes to new data that it hasn&#39;t seen before......For example, if the accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data is 0.8 (or 80%), this means that 80% of the predictions made by the model on the testing data were correct....Chance of survival could be done using various machine learning techniques, including decision trees, logistic regression, or support vector machines, among others. . | Code Below prepares data for further analysis and provides an Accuracy. IMO, you would insert a new passenger and predict survival. Datasets could be used on various factors like prediction if a player will hit a Home Run, or a Stock will go up or down. .

            "content": "Class and Object Terms . The foundations of Object-Oriented Programming is defining a Class . In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating an Object. (a data structure). An Object is used like many other Python variables. | A Class has ... a collection of data, these are called Attributes and in Python are pre-fixed using the keyword self | a collection of Functions/Procedures. These are called *Methods when they exist inside a Class definition. | . | An Object is created from the Class/Template. Characteristics of objects ... an Object is an Instance of the Class/Template | there can be many Objects created from the same Class | each Object contains its own Instance Data | the data is setup by the Constructor, this is the &quot;init&quot; method in a Python class | all methods in the Class/Template become part of the Object, methods are accessed using dot notation (object.method()) | . | A Python Class allow for the definition of @ decorators, these allow access to instance data without the use of functions ... @property decorator (aka getter). This enables developers to reference/get instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name versus object.get_name()) | @name.setter decorator (aka setter). This enables developers to update/set instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name = &quot;John&quot; versus object.set_name(&quot;John&quot;)) | observe all instance data (self._name, self.email ...) are prefixed with &quot;&quot;, this convention allows setters and getters to work with more natural variable name (name, email ...) | . | .

Some work can be graded quicker | Can be a detriment to those without access to technology | . Online videos | Entertainment geared towards your interests (often free) | Over obsession can lead to slothing | . Boston Dynamics robot dog | A pretty big step forward in robotics. Allows testing on new robotics to further its field of science | Not really sure what it can do other than that. Does not seem like it has much functional use | . Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School? | I think these are very extreme cases of gamers getting into games. While there&#39;s a fair amount of people in the gaming community like this, it&#39;s definitely not all. These are the most extreme cases of gaming, where you go as far as possible into it as you can. People who get into gaming don&#39;t tend to spend 18 hours a day on it, a large majority of gamers sprinkle it in their days, like you would a hobby. You could easily pull out the most extreme cases of any hobby and apply this thinking to that hobby, but it would be wrong, There&#39;s a lot more to gaming than this. Maybe something like gaming is easier to get dopamine out of, and it causes more people to be attracted to it and center their life around it, but I think it&#39;s no different from other hobbies. I, personally, am an avid gamer. I do my fair share of gaming. Gaming has not impacted my grades, not any more than the other pass times I enjoy. When it comes down to it, gaming is not the problem, the person is. You need to have the restraint and responsibility to know when you&#39;ve gone too far. Discipline like this should either be taught at a young age by parents or practiced in your own time. Overall, I don&#39;t think gaming is a hindrance to personal studies and high school in general. . 5.2 . How does someone empower themself in a digital world? | . Finding hobbies or pass times you enjoy. If you were to immerse yourself in these things and find groups who share your interests, you could do well without technology. I think finding your place without technology is empowering. . How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS. | . These questions are hard to answer. To be &quot;empowered&quot; is subjective. I don&#39;t know what I or you consider &quot;empowered&quot; and therefore don&#39;t know how to answer. Expressing your opinions, or feeling like you can, might be empowering. Letting your mind be known could give you a sense of empowerment. At Del Norte, I could be the one who knows. I could lend my ear to a friend or acquaintance so they feel empowered. . Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere? | . Now this is just straight gibberish. I have no idea what you could mean by &quot;paper or red tape.&quot; Even so, I might be able to answer this question. Paper does not affect the digital world. No matter what opinion you have, there will be someone who shares it on the internet. Absolutely any opinion has a group on the internet that you can join. No matter who you are, there are people who match you, who think like you, who believe what you believe in. There are no barriers. . 5.3 . What age groups use Facebook vs Tiktok? | . I think it&#39;s pretty clear that older people use Facebook, while younger people use Tiktok. Tiktok is geared towards younger people, with content that&#39;s a lot more flashy. Facebook is geared towards older people with a plain, informative website . Why do virtual assistants have female voices? | . The voices of virtual assistants is likely not with intent. When gauging public opinion, there was probably just more people who like the female voice compared to the male. With the first assistant having a female voice, the rest probably just followed suit. I don&#39;t think there was any ill intentions, and I don&#39;t think anything needs to be done about it. There&#39;s nothing harmful about it. Although females serving males was common preactice for a long time, that&#39;s no longer the case, and doesn&#39;t connect to virtual assistants. A female voice was probably more appealing because it can have a soothing, mother-like quality to it. . Algorithm that influences your decisions | . Algorithms in things like Netflix or Facebook are created to make you addicted to the platform. They are built to make you want to spend more time on the platform. With this, they can collect more data and sell you items that you would want. They can make money off your addiction to the site. . The HP computer | . I don&#39;t think the owner believes this was intentional. I think the &quot;HP computers are racist&quot; thing was to give a more humerous tone rather than a criticizing one. I don&#39;t really think this is harmful. While it is extremely weird, a function like this on a laptop camera is pretty negligible, especially since it doesn&#39;t hinder the functionality of the camera. Something like this is more like a silly little addition that doesn&#39;t add too much to the camera. I think it definitely should be corrected. This setting they&#39;ve created does not function as intended. It does not work for everyone and therefore should be fixed. A good way to prevent this would be to hand it to many employees for them to use. This puts it in public testing and allows for feedback to be easily deliviered since they work in the same company. Greater training too. Giving more data to the camera, different people, different lightings, different backgrounds, would ensure that no matter what, the camera could detect anyone. . 5.4 . Describe a crowdsource idea and how you initiate it. | . We could take a list of desserts and demand that people list them in order of most enjoyable. . Del Norte crowdsourcing? Can it improve your project? | . Yes, it could. By using the very example above, I could improve my project. My project is a cafe, and food will be important. Maybe we could take the opinions on what people want to see in a cafe, find a way to improve the cafe. . What data can you record at Night at the Museum? | . Opinions would be most important, any opinions. Opinions of the interface, content, or ideas that we&#39;ve put on our website could all help improve it. . 5.6 . Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principals | . Things like names in the about sections of pages. . Feelings on PII and personal exposure? | . I guess I feel indifferent to PII. There&#39;s really no way to feel about it, it&#39;s personal information. I guess I just disagree with DoB&#39;s level. I think that&#39;s something that everyone would/could know. Personal exposure is obviously bad. I don&#39;t want all of my information out there. . Describe good and bad passwords. What is another step that is used to assist in authentication? | . A bad password is something that is short, not complicated, and easy to guess. A good password is complicated, uses many different characters, and long. Two-step verification assists in authentification by making it harder for strangers to log in. It makes your account more secure. . Describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption | . Symmetric encryption uses one key to encrypt and decrypt information. Asymmetric encryption uses one key to encrypt and another to decrypt. . Provide an example of encryption we used in AWS deployment | . I don&#39;t remember any from the AWS deployment but I do remember the keys we used to create our fastpages. One was called the SSH key. . Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques | . I use a gaming platform called Steam. Someone I friended on Steam got hacked and asked me to vote for a team for some game. I agreed, but the website would have you sign in with your Steam account to take your information. I fell for it, but luckily I don&#39;t think any of my friends did, as the message was sent through me after I fell for it. Other phising techniques could be pop-ups on fishy websites, or emails to random emails. .",

I kept getting off track and couldn&#39;t think several times while trying to figure out what i was doing. I could have done this pretty quickly if I was normal and had an attention span longer than a goldfish. The code isnt too hard to understand. there&#39;s two lists and two variables. one pair is temporary and the other pair is the final pair. the temporary pair resets after each loop. if the temporary variable (the distance) is less than the final variable, then the final list and variable change to the temporary variable and list&#39;s values. The order of schools is randomized. It doesn&#39;t check for duplicates and doesn&#39;t end on del norte. it does, however, start on del norte. .

I&#39;m going to eliminate the joke immedietly by saying that it&#39;s impossible to win. This is true in two ways. First, the lottery is literally impossible. I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s rigged, it&#39;s just so extremely unlikely that the only way to properly express it is impossible. Second, it&#39;s impossible, I lied. I made this impossible as a goof. The value you input becomes pick but the code checks plck, which is a variable defined in the cell before. .",

            "content": "Purpose: Help students streamline and make their coding experience easier through built in packages and methods from a library Objective: By the end of the lesson, students should be able to fluently use methods from the turtle and math packages, and be able to look up documentation for any python package and us it. . fill in the blanks! . Libraries . Okay, so we&#39;ve learned a lot of code, and all of you now can boast that you can code at least some basic programs in python. But, what about more advanced stuff? What if there&#39;s a more advanced program you don&#39;t know how to make? Do you need to make it yourself? Well, not always. . You&#39;ve already learned about functions that you can write to reuse in your code in previous lessons. But,there are many others who code in python just like you. So why would you do again what someone has already done, and is available for any python user? . Packages allow a python user to import methods from a library, and use the methods in their code. Most libraries come with documentation on the different methods they entail and how to use them, and they can be found with a quick google search. methods are used with the following: . Note: a method from a package can only be used after the import statement. . Some libraries are always installed, such as those with the list methods which we have previously discussed. But others require a special python keyword called import. We will learn different ways to import in Challenge 1. . Sometimes we only need to import a single method from the package. We can do that with the word &quot;from&quot;, followed by the package name, then the word &quot;import&quot;, then the method. This will alllow you to use the method without mentioning the package&#39;s name, unlike what we did before, however other methods from that package cannot be used. To get the best of both worlds you can use &quot;*&quot;. . To import a method as an easier name, just do what we did first, add the word &quot;as&quot;, and write the name you would like to use that package as. . Challenge 1: Basic Libraries . Find a python package on the internet and import it | Choose a method from the package and import only the method | import the package as a more convenient name. | Challenge 2: Turtle . Turtle is a python __ library which allows you to draw all kinds of different shapes. It&#39;s ofter used to teach beginning python learners, but is really cool to use anywhere. Turtle employs a __ __ to display what you&#39;ve done, but unfortunately it&#39;s kind of annoying to make work with vscode. Use: repl.it Click &quot;+ Create&quot;, and for language, select &quot;Python (with Turtle)&quot; Documentation Task: Have fun with turtle! Create something that uses at least 2 lines of different lengths and 2 turns with different angles, and changes at least one setting about either the pen or canvas. Also use one command that isn&#39;t mentioned on the table below(there are a lot). Paste a screenshot of the code and the drawing from repl.it . Commands . forward(pixels) | . right(degrees) | . left(degrees) | . setpos(x,y) | . speed(speed) | . pensize(size) | . pencolor(color) | . Note: Color should be within quotes, like &quot;brown&quot;, or &quot;red&quot; . from turtle import * oogway = Turtle() . Challenge 3: Math . The math package allows for some really cool mathematical methods! . methods Action . ceil(x) | __ | . __ | rounds to largest intefer less than or equal to x | . factorial(x) | __ | . __ | returns the greatest common denominator of x and y | . lcm(x,y) | __ | . Challenge: Create a program which asks for a user input of two numbers, and returns the following: . each number rounded up | each number rounded down | the lcm of the rounded down numbers | the gcf of the rounded up numbers | the factorial of each number | something else using the math package! Documentation | . from math import * . Homework: Putting it all together(complete only after the random values lesson) . Option 1: Create a python program which generates a random number between 1 and 10, and use turtle to draw a regular polygon with that many sides. As a hint, remember that the total sum of all the angles in a polygon is (the number of sides - 2) * 180. Note: a regular polygon has all sides and angles the same size. Paste a screenshot of the code and the drawing from repl.it . Option 2: use the &quot;datetime&quot; package, and looking up documentation, create a program to generate 2 random dates and find the number of days between . Extra ideas: customize the settings, draw a picture, or something else! .",

            "title": "Searching Introduction",
            "content": "What is searching? . In certain computer programs and applications, one might find the need to locate and retrieve a data value and/or it&#39;s index. Searching algorithms could be done in either intervals or sequences, and certain algorithms could be more efficient than others, with benefits and drawbacks to each. . The Naive Approach . The most intuitively obvious solution to the searching problem is to sequentialy check each successful value in the data structure until either a matching value is found, or the entire structure has been transversed. This thought process could be explained graphically in this example . This algorithm could also be expressed in code, as shown below. . def sequentialSearch(arr, target): N = len(arr) # Declare N as length of array for i in range(N): # Iterate over the list if arr[i] == target: # Check for match return i # Match found, return index and end function call return -1 # Element not found . Sequential Search - Larger Inputs . Although for selection sort is seemingly fast for smaller inputs, it is clear that it cannot keep up with increasing input sizes. Because sequential search checks every value of the given array, the algorithm&#39;s overall runtime increases &quot;linearly&quot; with the input size. . i.e. Pretend that one check takes one second, and that we are searching for the last element in an array. If the array length is 4, it would take 4 seconds to find the last element, whereas if the array length is 86400 indices long, it would take a whole day to find the element. . Hence, although selection sort is known for its simplicity, it is unfeasible for large inputs . Below, we have created three sorted lists of length 100,1000000,100000000. . import time arr1 = [i for i in range(100)] arr2 = [i for i in range(1000000)] arr3 = [i for i in range(100000000)] . To analyze the sequential search algorithm, we will check for the worst case scenario, where runtime is maximized. This is because when measuring the efficiency of our algorithm, we want to be able to guarantee an upper limit or set amount of time for our program to finish running. To do this, we will attempt to search for the last element in the array . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr1)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, sequentialSearch(arr1,99)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100 Index: 99 Execution time: 0.05602836608886719 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr2)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, sequentialSearch(arr2,999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 1000000 Index: 999999 Execution time: 58.67457389831543 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr3)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, sequentialSearch(arr3,99999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100000000 Index: 99999999 Execution time: 5162.384986877441 ms . As you can see, as the input list grows larger and larger, the overall runtime of the program increases linearly as well, resulting in a lower scalability for the sequential search algorithm. . Binary Search . Binary search is an efficient way to iterate through a SORTED list to find a requested value. This is done through checking the middle value of a list and checking if the requested value is greater than or less than the middle value. You can start to see why the requested list must be sorted. If the list is not sorted, this logic is flawed, and the binary search algorithm will no longer work. . Unlike the sequential search method, binary search doesn&#39;t check for each successive element until a match is found. In every iteration the algorithm is making a binary decision; if the selected element is larger or smaller than the target. . How exactly does this work? Lets look at these amazing ms paint drawings: . i was too lazy to make a third so ur gonna have to live with 2 :) . This algorithm is extremely efficient as the maximum number of cycles in binary search is equal to log base 2 of the closest, next power of two, to length of list. . If the array is 8 items long, the maximum possible cycles would be 3 (log base 2 of 8 is 3) . If the array is 7 items long, the maximum possible cycles would STILL be 3 as the closest power of 2 to 7 is 8. . If the array is 9 items long, the maximum possible cycles INCREASES to 4, as the closest, next power of two, is 16. . def binarySearch(array, target): # Parameters: array is the given array and target is what we are looking for low = 0 # the starting lower bound high = len(array)-1 # the starting upper bound while high &gt;= low: # we will keep running until we run out of possible subarrays... mid = (high + low) // 2 # define the middle of the list to be the item at the index of the average of the lower and upper bound if array[mid] == target: # if item is in the middle of the list... we found what we are looking for! return mid # therefore, we return the index of where we found the item. elif array[mid] &gt; target: # if item is less than the middle of the list, this must mean that the item is on the lower half of the list high = mid-1 # therefore, we set the upper bound of the search to be the last item of the lower half else: # if item is neither less than or equal to the middle of the list, this must mean that the item is on the upper half of the list low = mid+1 # therefore, we set the lower bound of the search to be the first item of the upper half # if nothing is returned by the time the while loop ends, that means item MUST be missing from list return False # therefore we tell the user that the requested item was not found . Likewise, we can also take a recursive approach to this problem, note the similarities . def BinarySearchRecursion(arr, target, lo, hi): if lo &gt; hi: return False mid = (lo+hi)//2 if arr[mid] == target: return mid elif arr[mid] &gt; target: return BinarySearchRecursion(arr, target, lo, mid-1) elif arr[mid] &lt; target: return BinarySearchRecursion(arr, target, mid+1, hi) . Now, let&#39;s compare the runtime with the same lists we tried with the sequential search algorithm. . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr1)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr1,99)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100 Index: 99 Execution time: 0.05507469177246094 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr2)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr2,999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 1000000 Index: 999999 Execution time: 0.17070770263671875 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr3)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr3,99999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100000000 Index: 99999999 Execution time: 0.06628036499023438 ms . arr4 = [1,4,5,8,10,13,145,1938] print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr4,17)) .

Convert the result back to decimal: 11000000.10101000.00000000.00000000 -&gt; 192.168.0.0 | The network address is 192.168.0.0 .",

To solve the same problem, many different algorithms can be used. . Therefore, algorithms are very important for programmers, and today we&#39;re going to explore how to determine the outcome of algorithms, how to deteremine the output of similar algorithms, how to edit existing algorithms, and how to develop our own algorithms. . Determine the outcome of algorithms . Consider the following algorithm. . def mystery(num, num2): if (num % num2 == 0): print(&quot;True&quot;) else: print(&quot;False&quot;) mystery(20, 4) . True . What does the algorithm do? Please explain in words. | What if I put in 30 as num and 4 as num2. What would be the output? | Determine the outcome of similar algorithms . What is the output of this algorithm? . temp = 95 if (temp &gt;= 90): print(&quot;it is too hot outside&quot;) else: if (temp &gt;= 65): print(&quot;I will go outside&quot;) else: print(&quot;it is too cold outside&quot;) . What is the output of this algorithm? it looks similar but the output is different! . temp = 95 if (temp &gt;= 90): print(&quot;it is too hot outside&quot;) if (temp &gt;= 65): print(&quot;i will go outside&quot;) if (temp &lt; 65): print(&quot;it is too cold outside&quot;) . Editing Algorithms . Task: Please edit the algorithm above to have it yield the same results as the previous algorithm! (no matter what temp you put in) . Developing Algorithms . To develop algorithms, we first need to understand what the question is asking. Then, think about how you would approach it as a human and then try to find what pattern you went through to arrive at the answer. Apply this to code, and there you have it! An algorithm! . Let&#39;s say you wanted to sum up the first five integers. How would you do this in real life? Your thought process would probably be: . The sum of the first integer is 1. | Then, increase that integer by 1. I now add 2 to my existing sum (1). My new sum is 3. | Repeat until I add 5 to my sum. The resulting sum is 15. | . Now let&#39;s translate this into code. . sum = 0 # start with a sum of 0 for i in range (1, 6): # you will repeat the process five times for integers 1-5 sum = sum + i # add the number to your sum print(sum) # print the result . 15 . Task: Write an algorithm in python that sums up the first 5 odd integers. You can use the following code as a starter. . sum = ? counter = ? for i in range (0, ?): sum = sum + ? counter = counter + ? . Homework . Create an algorithm that will start with any positive integer n and display the full sequence of numbers that result from the Collatz Conjecture. The COllatz Conjecture is as follows: . start with any positive integer | if the number is even, divide by 2 | if the number is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1 | repeat steps 2 and 3 until you reach 1 | Example: if the starting number was 6, the output would be 6, 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 .",

            "content": "Final Blog . A blog for the Night at the Museum findings and missed test questions on the final . Night at the Museum . SAT Practice Questions . . One of the projects I saw at Night at the Museum was a website for practice SAT questions. There was a quiz with 5 randomly generated questions to answer. Each question was mulitple choice and would give immediate feedback which choice was correct. On click, the correct answer would change to correct, and the incorrect answers would change to incorrect. At the bottom of the page, it would give you your total score. The quiz could be done again by refreshing the page and each time you’ll get a different set of answers. Each question doesn’t give you an indication on if you got it right or wrong. After picking your answer each choice will change to right or wrong but there’s no color indication or bold on the answer you picked. This is not a huge problem but if you forgot which answer you picked then it can be a little troubling. This is a little nit pick but I don’t really like how the choices disappear after you pick one. Since they change to “correct” or “incorrect,” if you got it wrong you don’t get a chance afterward to find out what the correct answer is. I’m sure there was much more to this project but I wasn’t there for the whole presentation. . Work Watch . . This was my friend’s project. It’s a stopwatch that helps you manage your assignments. You can set 5 tasks, giving each a name and how long they’ll take, and how often and long you want your breaks to be. There’s other bells and whistles to it for comfort of life. I believe there’s an alarm that goes of for each event. for breaks starting and ending, and tasks ending. There’s also a chart for each of the alarms. There’s a full list of each alarm and you can vote on which alarm you like. The alarm with the highest likes (and dislikes may be taken into account) will be set to the alarm on the watch. You can’t change the alarm yourself, at least not to my knowledge. . My Project Ideas for Next Trimester . I don’t have many ideas on what to do next trimester. I saw that the group behind me was doing games for their project. I think that’s really cool and I also want to do something like that. I didn’t see the actual games, but I saw tetris and snake on their main.py file. I was also working on an rpg game as a personal project. It was a text rpg and was only the battle part of an rpg but that would be cool for a project. Making a game for a project would be fun. . Missed Questions on Test . There were two questions I got wrong on the Final. . Which of the following are true statements about the data that can be represented using binary sequences? . Binary sequences can be used to represent strings of characters. | Binary sequences can be used to represent colors. | Binary sequences can be used to represent audio recordings. | This was the first question I got wrong. I think I chose 1 and 2 but the answer was 1, 2, and 3. Honestly I don’t know anything about binary, I don’t remember learning anything about it in class. I ended up figuring out most of the questions about binary, but something like this is hard to figure out without background knowledge. . The position of a runner in a race is a type of analog data. The runner’s position is tracked using sensors. Which of the following best describes how the position of the runner is represented digitally? . The position of the runner is determined by calculating the time difference between the start and the end of the race and making an estimation based on the runner’s average speed. | The position of the runner is measured and rounded to either 0 or 1 depending on whether the runner is closer to the starting line or closer to the finish line. | The position of the runner is predicted using a model based on performance data captured from previous races. | The position of the runner is sampled at regular intervals to approximate the real-word position, and a sequence of bits is used to represent each sample | I understand it now. At first, this didn’t really make sense to me. I chose 1 and the answer was 4. I actually knew the answer was 4 while doing this question, but didn’t know that it was the answer. I knew that the sensors would be periodic around the track, but I thought that 1 would calculate the time difference between each sensor. Also, the second half of 4 confused me, I have no idea what that means. I also don’t know what analog data is. Basically, I thought the answer was part of the question, and got it wrong. .",

This code planning begins by coming up with some jokes and defining a data &quot;model&quot; to keep and manage the jokes. . jokes_data contains a list of dictionary records containing joke and reactions:haha or boohoo - joke_list contains collection of jokes we will put into jokes_data | . | Next comes some functions to interact with our jokes . def initJokes(): initializes jokes_data | def getJokes(): returns the complete list of jokes | def getJoke(): returns a single joke from our list | ... many more function can be examined by reading comments below ... | . | . import random jokes_data = [] joke_list = [ &quot;If you give someone a program... you will frustrate them for a day; if you teach them how to program... you will &quot; &quot;frustrate them for a lifetime.&quot;, &quot;Q: Why did I divide sin by tan?

Backend Interface for Web API (Control) . An application programming interface (API) is the medium by which different systems of software interact. In our applications we have two big systems:1. Python Backend that stores data beyond a single Web page2. GH Pages/Fastpages Frontend that is responsible for presenting data . To communicate data between Frontend and Backend, this section Backend code provides and interface to the Frontend using a Web Service Endpoint. Examples of endpoints are listed below and can be typed within a browser, which will return JSON data: . https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes | https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes/2 | https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes/random | . As you can see, these Endpoints return JSON. They are NOT that readable by normal humans. However, they are very effective in passing requested data across the Internet. The Frontend code is responsible for formatting and presenting and interface that allows the typical computer user to interact with this data. . The next cell of code is Creating Endpoints that return JSON. This allows developers in the Frontend to interact with Backend data. API is a contract between the Frontend and Backend on how to share data. . FYI, there is NO output from this section . . from flask import Blueprint, jsonify # jsonify creates an endpoint response object from flask_restful import Api, Resource # used for REST API building import requests # used for testing import random # Blueprints allow this code to be procedurally abstracted from main.py, meaning code is not all in one place app_api = Blueprint(&#39;api&#39;, __name__, url_prefix=&#39;/api/jokes&#39;) # endpoint prefix avoid redundantly typing /api/jokes over and over # API generator https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#id1 api = Api(app_api) class JokesAPI: # not implemented, this would be where we would allow creation of a new Joke class _Create(Resource): def post(self, joke): pass # getJokes() class _Read(Resource): def get(self): return jsonify(getJokes()) # getJoke(id) class _ReadID(Resource): def get(self, id): return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # getRandomJoke() class _ReadRandom(Resource): def get(self): return jsonify(getRandomJoke()) # getRandomJoke() class _ReadCount(Resource): def get(self): count = countJokes() countMsg = {&#39;count&#39;: count} return jsonify(countMsg) # put method: addJokeHaHa class _UpdateLike(Resource): def put(self, id): addJokeHaHa(id) return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # put method: addJokeBooHoo class _UpdateJeer(Resource): def put(self, id): addJokeBooHoo(id) return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # building RESTapi interfaces, these routes are added to Web Server http://&lt;server&lt;/api/jokes api.add_resource(_Create, &#39;/create/&lt;string:joke&gt;&#39;) api.add_resource(_Read, &#39;/&#39;) # default, which returns all jokes api.add_resource(_ReadID, &#39;/&lt;int:id&gt;&#39;) api.add_resource(_ReadRandom, &#39;/random&#39;) api.add_resource(_ReadCount, &#39;/count&#39;) api.add_resource(_UpdateLike, &#39;/like/&lt;int:id&gt;/&#39;) api.add_resource(_UpdateJeer, &#39;/jeer/&lt;int:id&gt;/&#39;) . Frontend (View Simulation) and Hacks . This python codes tests endpoints on a server. This can be handy for development and testing when making modifications to the Jokes Web APIs. This code works off of the server endpoint/url, not from code cells above it in this notebook. . To work with this code and make observation for learning... .

As more and more developers use APIs, they build standards in how you setup a client, send requests and receive information... . Covid19 RapidAPI Example . To begin the API journey. You need to find an API provider. . RapidAPI is a great option. You must setup and account, but there are many free options. | Goto this page for starters, the Corona virus World and India data- Under Code Snippets pick Python - Requests | . RapidAPI, you will select Python Requests type of code to work with you Notebook. . The url is the endpoint to which the API is directed | The headers is a dictionary data structure to send special messaging to the endpoint | The requests.request() python function is used to send a request and retrieve their responses | The response variable receives result of of the request in JSON text | . Next step, is to format the response according to your data science needs . &quot;&quot;&quot; Requests is a HTTP library for the Python programming language. The goal of the project is to make HTTP requests simpler and more human-friendly. &quot;&quot;&quot; import requests url = &quot;https://corona-virus-world-and-india-data.p.rapidapi.com/api&quot; headers = { &quot;X-RapidAPI-Key&quot;: &quot;a7b9e240e2mshc52362d1e196908p1d0305jsn22e376b200cb&quot;, &quot;X-RapidAPI-Host&quot;: &quot;corona-virus-world-and-india-data.p.rapidapi.com&quot; } response = requests.request(&quot;GET&quot;, url, headers=headers) print(response.json()) print() # This code looks for USA in &quot;countries_stats&quot; print(&quot;Country Totals&quot;) countries = response.json().get(&#39;countries_stat&#39;) for country in countries: # countries is a list if country[&quot;country_name&quot;] == &quot;USA&quot;: # this filters for USA for key, value in country.items(): # this finds key, value pairs in country print(key, value) . import requests url = &quot;https://pokedex2.p.rapidapi.com/pokedex/uk&quot; headers = { &quot;X-RapidAPI-Key&quot;: &quot;a7b9e240e2mshc52362d1e196908p1d0305jsn22e376b200cb&quot;, &quot;X-RapidAPI-Host&quot;: &quot;pokedex2.p.rapidapi.com&quot; } response = requests.request(&quot;GET&quot;, url, headers=headers) print(response.json()) print() print(&quot;Pokemon Stats&quot;) pokemons = response.json() for pokemon in pokemons: if pokemon[&quot;name&quot;] == &#39;Wooper&#39;: for key, value in pokemon.items(): print(key, value) . {&#39;message&#39;: &#39;You have exceeded the MONTHLY quota for Requests on your current plan, BASIC.

Because of this, they may not be completely coherent . Imporant task reqiurements . A list must be created and used in the program. . A function must be included. Similar but not the same as the for_loop . DnD . The dnd project i made fleshed out to be interactable with written inputs impacting the story the choices will have to be limited. . maybe make a new story rather than the cold war one so there&#39;s more choices . lists could be implimented using choices; . -an empty list could be made for choice storing in the future . -when certain choices are made, something could be appended to a list . -when that certain choice has an impact in the future story, an if/else could be used with the list to determine if it&#39;s changed . list append could also be used for keeping score, but i wouldnt know what for and theres probably better ways . space invaders . The game I made in 6th grade, but without the handicap of scratch . not sure how I could create this using python based on how its been used so far I might jsut scratch this idea . I also dont really like the idea, kinda basic . RPG . I could make some sort of rpg fight, similar to how some games used to just be in text . this could be fun, i could use many different things as inpiration for enemys/attacks, especially since it&#39;ll be just text . this will very likely impliment lists . lists could be used to hold damage values, weapons, enemy and player attacks, . adding a buff system could make it more complicated . I think how it will work is there will be a lot of functions defined at the top for attacking and such and as the text progresses many if/else statements will be used to determine which function to use. it might be better to just use if statements without the else so i can cover more options. . how the choices are made will be through input. I&#39;ll add a prompt at the top to ask people to only type in lowercase so there&#39;s no errors. . I&#39;ll have to find a way for the choice prompt to restart if an undefined prompt is inputted. . a list can be used to define damage values. A random number generator can be used to choose a number from that list. the damage values can also contain a miss or something. There&#39;s probably a better way to choose random damage values than what i just described. . probably 2 or three enemies . im thinking that a choice of which to attack will be provided first, which then leads to a choice of attacking and whatnot . i could probably use somesort of if statement to make certain attacks less/more effective to enemies. i could make them add or subtract a predetermined amount after a ranodm number is generated . probably just multiple attack choices. . I could add a defense option, using the same method used for the less/more effective attakcs . if defense optino added, I should have it reset a certain value after each turn. if not then the defense will be infinite . make the whole process of a turn a function. this eay i can repeat is more often without typing so much . use a loop with an if statement so the turns will keep going until someone dies DEFINITELY LOOK INTO A BETTER WAY TO DO THIS . make the numbers in the list a variable. i think if you do this then you can add and subtract from them. ex: instead of [1,2,3] its [n1,n2,n3] and n1=(1) etc. .",

[20] . After Code . I have just finished the odd number test, it took about 3 classes to finish. It took a bit but the odd number test works and I&#39;m very glad. This was a very fun thing to work on, it wasn&#39;t an assignment for class, it was just something I started out of curiosity of &quot;can I do it&quot; and finished because I had fun trying to figure out how to do it. Technically it&#39;s not complete, the last bit of the code I want is to clear the output so only the print(oddbool) bit is printed but I haven&#39;t figured out how to do that yet. For now, it&#39;s finished but not polished. . I want to get a little more into the code, so I can show how I did it and why it could be weird looking. The first bit is the imports but that&#39;s not too important. They were a random number generator, an output checker, and an output clearer. I only ended up using the random generator because I couldn&#39;t figure out how to work the other two. Now I&#39;ll get into the real code. . The first bit is the lists and variables. I slowly put more and more in as I continued coding, each has a purpose; ranumlist is the list that contains the randomly generated numbers, they&#39;re appended later on so they&#39;re always different. list4 was for the for_loop. I think it originally contained only four numbers so the for_loop would loop 4 times but I&#39;m not sure. n4 is a variable for 4, it was also for the for_loop with the same reason as list4. Honestly, I never really figured out how the loops worked. I don&#39;t know how the variables and lists affect the for loop when defining it. n10 is for the num_loop, it was created to loop num_loop 10 times for each of the odd numbers, I&#39;ll get into that later. oddNum is a list of all the odd numbers that can be generated, this is so I can compare each number to the number generated. n0 is a very important piece of the code. n0 is used to choose a list item from oddNum. Later I will explain how it plays into the code. n1 is an empty variable. It actually equals 1 but it&#39;s only used to fill space in an if else statement. Last is oddbool, it&#39;s used to tell another chunk of code if the number is odd. . The for_loop is the first chunk of code. It&#39;s used to add random numbers to ranumlist .",
