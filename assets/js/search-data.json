            "content": "Night at the Museum . SAT Practice Questions . [INSERT IMAGE] . One of the projects I saw at Night at the Museum was a website for practice SAT questions. There was a quiz with 5 randomly generated questions to answer. Each question was mulitple choice and would give immediate feedback which choice was correct. On click, the correct answer would change to correct, and the incorrect answers would change to incorrect. At the bottom of the page, it would give you your total score. The quiz could be done again by refreshing the page and each time you&#39;ll get a different set of answers. Each question doesn&#39;t give you an indication on if you got it right or wrong. After picking your answer each choice will change to right or wrong but there&#39;s no color indication or bold on the answer you picked. This is not a huge problem but if you forgot which answer you picked then it can be a little troubling. This is a little nit pick but I don&#39;t really like how the choices disappear after you pick one. Since they change to &quot;correct&quot; or &quot;incorrect,&quot; if you got it wrong you don&#39;t get a chance afterward to find out what the correct answer is. I&#39;m sure there was much more to this project but I wasn&#39;t there for the whole presentation. . Work Watch . [INSERT IMAGE] . This was my friend&#39;s project. It&#39;s a stopwatch that helps you manage your assignments. You can set 5 tasks, giving each a name and how long they&#39;ll take, and how often and long you want your breaks to be. There&#39;s other bells and whistles to it for comfort of life. I believe there&#39;s an alarm that goes of for each event. for breaks starting and ending, and tasks ending. There&#39;s also a chart for each of the alarms. There&#39;s a full list of each alarm and you can vote on which alarm you like. The alarm with the highest likes (and dislikes may be taken into account) will be set to the alarm on the watch. You can&#39;t change the alarm yourself, at least not to my knowledge. . My Project Ideas for Next Trimester . I don&#39;t have many ideas on what to do next trimester. I saw that the group behind me was doing games for their project. I think that&#39;s really cool and I also want to do something like that. I didn&#39;t see the actual games, but I saw tetris and snake on their main.py file. I was also working on an rpg game as a personal project. It was a text rpg and was only the battle part of an rpg but that would be cool for a project. Making a game for a project would be fun. .

Backend Interface for Web API (Control) . An application programming interface (API) is the medium by which different systems of software interact. In our applications we have two big systems:1. Python Backend that stores data beyond a single Web page2. GH Pages/Fastpages Frontend that is responsible for presenting data . To communicate data between Frontend and Backend, this section Backend code provides and interface to the Frontend using a Web Service Endpoint. Examples of endpoints are listed below and can be typed within a browser, which will return JSON data: . https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes | https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes/2 | https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes/random | . As you can see, these Endpoints return JSON. They are NOT that readable by normal humans. However, they are very effective in passing requested data across the Internet. The Frontend code is responsible for formatting and presenting and interface that allows the typical computer user to interact with this data. . The next cell of code is Creating Endpoints that return JSON. This allows developers in the Frontend to interact with Backend data. API is a contract between the Frontend and Backend on how to share data. . FYI, there is NO output from this section . . from flask import Blueprint, jsonify # jsonify creates an endpoint response object from flask_restful import Api, Resource # used for REST API building import requests # used for testing import random # Blueprints allow this code to be procedurally abstracted from main.py, meaning code is not all in one place app_api = Blueprint(&#39;api&#39;, __name__, url_prefix=&#39;/api/jokes&#39;) # endpoint prefix avoid redundantly typing /api/jokes over and over # API generator https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#id1 api = Api(app_api) class JokesAPI: # not implemented, this would be where we would allow creation of a new Joke class _Create(Resource): def post(self, joke): pass # getJokes() class _Read(Resource): def get(self): return jsonify(getJokes()) # getJoke(id) class _ReadID(Resource): def get(self, id): return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # getRandomJoke() class _ReadRandom(Resource): def get(self): return jsonify(getRandomJoke()) # getRandomJoke() class _ReadCount(Resource): def get(self): count = countJokes() countMsg = {&#39;count&#39;: count} return jsonify(countMsg) # put method: addJokeHaHa class _UpdateLike(Resource): def put(self, id): addJokeHaHa(id) return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # put method: addJokeBooHoo class _UpdateJeer(Resource): def put(self, id): addJokeBooHoo(id) return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # building RESTapi interfaces, these routes are added to Web Server http://&lt;server&lt;/api/jokes api.add_resource(_Create, &#39;/create/&lt;string:joke&gt;&#39;) api.add_resource(_Read, &#39;/&#39;) # default, which returns all jokes api.add_resource(_ReadID, &#39;/&lt;int:id&gt;&#39;) api.add_resource(_ReadRandom, &#39;/random&#39;) api.add_resource(_ReadCount, &#39;/count&#39;) api.add_resource(_UpdateLike, &#39;/like/&lt;int:id&gt;/&#39;) api.add_resource(_UpdateJeer, &#39;/jeer/&lt;int:id&gt;/&#39;) .

As more and more developers use APIs, they build standards in how you setup a client, send requests and receive information... . Covid19 RapidAPI Example . To begin the API journey. You need to find an API provider. . RapidAPI is a great option. You must setup and account, but there are many free options. | Goto this page for starters, the Corona virus World and India data- Under Code Snippets pick Python - Requests | . RapidAPI, you will select Python Requests type of code to work with you Notebook. . The url is the endpoint to which the API is directed | The headers is a dictionary data structure to send special messaging to the endpoint | The requests.request() python function is used to send a request and retrieve their responses | The response variable receives result of of the request in JSON text | . Next step, is to format the response according to your data science needs . &quot;&quot;&quot; Requests is a HTTP library for the Python programming language.

            "content": "My ideas will be written here. Ill write down thoughts so i can think out certain parts of my ideas, to get more into what it will be like. Because of this, they may not be completely coherent . Imporant task reqiurements . A list must be created and used in the program. . A function must be included. Similar but not the same as the for_loop . DnD . The dnd project i made fleshed out to be interactable with written inputs impacting the story the choices will have to be limited. . maybe make a new story rather than the cold war one so there&#39;s more choices . lists could be implimented using choices; . -an empty list could be made for choice storing in the future . -when certain choices are made, something could be appended to a list . -when that certain choice has an impact in the future story, an if/else could be used with the list to determine if it&#39;s changed . list append could also be used for keeping score, but i wouldnt know what for and theres probably better ways . space invaders . The game I made in 6th grade, but without the handicap of scratch . not sure how I could create this using python based on how its been used so far I might jsut scratch this idea . I also dont really like the idea, kinda basic . RPG . I could make some sort of rpg fight, similar to how some games used to just be in text . this could be fun, i could use many different things as inpiration for enemys/attacks, especially since it&#39;ll be just text . this will very likely impliment lists . lists could be used to hold damage values, weapons, enemy and player attacks, . adding a buff system could make it more complicated . I think how it will work is there will be a lot of functions defined at the top for attacking and such and as the text progresses many if/else statements will be used to determine which function to use. it might be better to just use if statements without the else so i can cover more options. . how the choices are made will be through input. I&#39;ll add a prompt at the top to ask people to only type in lowercase so there&#39;s no errors. . I&#39;ll have to find a way for the choice prompt to restart if an undefined prompt is inputted. . a list can be used to define damage values. A random number generator can be used to choose a number from that list. the damage values can also contain a miss or something. There&#39;s probably a better way to choose random damage values than what i just described. . probably 2 or three enemies . im thinking that a choice of which to attack will be provided first, which then leads to a choice of attacking and whatnot . i could probably use somesort of if statement to make certain attacks less/more effective to enemies. i could make them add or subtract a predetermined amount after a ranodm number is generated . probably just multiple attack choices. . I could add a defense option, using the same method used for the less/more effective attakcs . if defense optino added, I should have it reset a certain value after each turn. if not then the defense will be infinite . make the whole process of a turn a function. this eay i can repeat is more often without typing so much . use a loop with an if statement so the turns will keep going until someone dies DEFINITELY LOOK INTO A BETTER WAY TO DO THIS . make the numbers in the list a variable. i think if you do this then you can add and subtract from them. ex: instead of [1,2,3] its [n1,n2,n3] and n1=(1) etc. .",

For loop output [11, 11, 4, 4, 1] 11 Number loop output Add loop output Add loop output Add loop output Add loop output Add loop output Add loop output Add loop output Add loop output Add loop output Add loop output odd [10] 1 . msg = (20) lsit = [] lsit.append (msg) print(lsit) . [20] . After Code . I have just finished the odd number test, it took about 3 classes to finish. It took a bit but the odd number test works and I&#39;m very glad. This was a very fun thing to work on, it wasn&#39;t an assignment for class, it was just something I started out of curiosity of &quot;can I do it&quot; and finished because I had fun trying to figure out how to do it. Technically it&#39;s not complete, the last bit of the code I want is to clear the output so only the print(oddbool) bit is printed but I haven&#39;t figured out how to do that yet. For now, it&#39;s finished but not polished. . I want to get a little more into the code, so I can show how I did it and why it could be weird looking. The first bit is the imports but that&#39;s not too important. They were a random number generator, an output checker, and an output clearer. I only ended up using the random generator because I couldn&#39;t figure out how to work the other two. Now I&#39;ll get into the real code. . The first bit is the lists and variables. I slowly put more and more in as I continued coding, each has a purpose; ranumlist is the list that contains the randomly generated numbers, they&#39;re appended later on so they&#39;re always different. list4 was for the for_loop. I think it originally contained only four numbers so the for_loop would loop 4 times but I&#39;m not sure. n4 is a variable for 4, it was also for the for_loop with the same reason as list4. Honestly, I never really figured out how the loops worked. I don&#39;t know how the variables and lists affect the for loop when defining it. n10 is for the num_loop, it was created to loop num_loop 10 times for each of the odd numbers, I&#39;ll get into that later. oddNum is a list of all the odd numbers that can be generated, this is so I can compare each number to the number generated. n0 is a very important piece of the code. n0 is used to choose a list item from oddNum. Later I will explain how it plays into the code. n1 is an empty variable. It actually equals 1 but it&#39;s only used to fill space in an if else statement. Last is oddbool, it&#39;s used to tell another chunk of code if the number is odd. . The for_loop is the first chunk of code. It&#39;s used to add random numbers to ranumlist .",

I&#39;ve gotten help from Drew and the teachers and can now edit my website from vscode. . As a reminder for later, I&#39;ll put some html things here (replace ^ with left and right arrows); ^a href=&quot;(insert link here)&quot;^ is for links, . This html knowledge will not help me, I was supposed to be making .ipynb files instead of .md files. Now I know, and will continue using jupyter notebooks instead. The jupyter notebooks use python, however, and it&#39;s a lot more complicated than html&#39;s ^p^ and ^/p^ . .",
