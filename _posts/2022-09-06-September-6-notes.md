<p>Our assignment this week is to make a three question quiz using code.org with a partner.</p>

<p>I've made a very bad quiz. It was put together pretty quickly. I'll put a link to it. <a href="https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/jL0yHKzp6fbT1SgLsaZoBj4sZsEYzg2vhfZSqev5jG0">https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/jL0yHKzp6fbT1SgLsaZoBj4sZsEYzg2vhfZSqev5jG0</a> It's three questions like the assignment required, there's an incorrect and correct screen, that's kind of all. sadly i wasn't able to work on my personal project today but whatever</p>
