# Reflection

This year in computer science, I learned a lot of things. Before this class, I had zero programming skills. I knew console.log(), but I probably thought that was Python. Now, I'd say I'm pretty fluent in Javascript and Python. I've also recently learned threejs, an addon to Javascript to make 3D objects, although I'm not very skilled at it yet. I've also learned a tiny bit of C++ on the side, because making games is cool. I was only writing stuff in console, though. A low was definitely the first trimester. I took this class with my friend Drew Reed, but he wasn't in my class the first trimester. I had to learn coding from scratch without my good friend Drew Reed, which kinda sucked. A high was second and third trimester. I had my good friend Drew Reed in my class in second trimester, and my good friend Luke Angelini in my class in third trimester. Those classes entirely were great becasuse I had my friends in them. I plan to continue computer science. I enjoy coding a lot, and want to major it in college. I'm going to UTEP (University of Texas at El Paso) to major in computer science, the school's good with engineering and I got some family there. Overall, Computer Science was great. I got to learn really interesting stuff, make cool things, and have a good time with my friends.
